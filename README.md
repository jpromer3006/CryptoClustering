Clustering
##Using Co-pilot and Xbert Assistance, study group 5
##Examining Crypto Currency price fluctuations spanning 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 200 days, and 1 year to see fluctuations and cluster patterns.
#Pulled CSV file to clean Data and prepare for scaling.  Using K-means model technique to plot Elbow curve to determine best choice for clustering is 4k.  Another DF was then created to find the PCA.  When summing PCA1, 2, 3, 4 most of the data was being used when running the model suggesting that the model was making an informed decision, despite cleaning the data. Once the clusters have been identified we see what features of the data have a positive or negative influence.
